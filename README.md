## Description

This website was created to generate a random password for anyone to use. It showcases the use of logic and manipulation of the window object using JavaScript. 


## Usage

Press the red button that says "Generate Password" and a window prompt will pop up asking how many characters you want your password to be. If there is a valid input, more prompts will pop up asking about types of characters desired in the password. After all the questions are answered, a password that meets all of your requirements will appear on the screen.

## Citations

This code was originally created in a web development bootcamp put on by Uconn in the following repo: C:\Users\kinga\bootcamp\class-repo\CONN-VIRT-FSF-PT-07-2023-U-LOLC\03-JavaScript\02-Challenge. The css and html were entirely sourced from the class. The JavaScript had some starter code provided from the class, and the generatePassword function was created by me.
